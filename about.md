  Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?' - Marcus Aurelius

Hi I'm Chris.

I program computers. I'm a father and husband. I like to read.

The sidebar has links to my CV, LinkedIN, Gitlab, Github, StackOverflow if you care about that sort of thing. 

I have long contemplated creating a blog but never found what I had to say valuable enough to share. I've since learned that journaling can be therapeutic and that my bar for what's valuable has been too high. 

Thanks for reading.
